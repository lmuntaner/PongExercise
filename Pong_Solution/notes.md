- Start by building a black canvas
- Don't do IIEF from the beginning

- Create Ball Class
  - Make it appear
  - Make it move. setInterval
  - .bind(this), expanation about setInterval calling style (function vs method style)
  - Rebound on every side

  - Add listeners to move them
  - No need to add limits at the sides, leave that for them.
  - Make the ball bounce at the touch of the paddle
- Create Board Class
  - Separate in files
  - Create the ball and paddles in initialization of Board
  - Refactor render method to render background separetely.

  - Add listener to start match. Bug if you don't remove the listener.
  - removeEventListener
  - Make start again when ball touches either side
  - clearInterval
- Add the Score
  - Create the instance variable in the paddle object
